RobotDance
==========

a keyboard controlled Humanoid Robot using python 2.7 and pyOpenGL bindings. (Also it uses GLUT but I think pyOpenGL took 
care of that too.)

Further Scope of improvement:
  -can enable the robot to 'dance' by accepting a 'song' which will consist of a string of characters, where each one 
   of the characters enable an atomic movement of the robot.
